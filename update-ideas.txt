A list of things that I would like to do (if they are possible), but don't want to commit to, so they are not in the readme/description
- Improve visibility of Spidertron Engineer upgrades in tech tree
- Change item descriptions to reflect space science changes when those settings are active
- More configurable size changes
- Support for cannon shells
- Proper Spidertron corpse with inventory upon death?
- Let path speed bonuses affect the Spidertron?
