Spidertron Engineer
==================

Are you tired of walking around on only 2 legs? Now you can live your whole life as a hulking 8-legged spider mech!

-----
Major Features
-----

- Spawn from the start as a Spidertron (with no way to exit it!*)
- Starting Spidertron stats are adjusted to be comparable to a normal engineer
- Reworked military and armor research technologies to add weapons, armor, inventory and equipment grid slots to the Spidertron instead
    - For example, when the Modular Armor research is completed, 10 inventory slots, a small equipment grid, and increased health and resistances are applied directly to all players’ Spidertrons
- Optional space science rework (thank you to [Polsefel](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/ii5k95/altf4_2_spidertron/g34mf8l) for the suggestion)
    - Launch spidertrons into space instead of satellites to obtain space science packs
    - Reclaim fish from the rocket either directly or by converting space science into fish
- Optionally spawn with a spidertron remote configured to control your own Spidertron Engineer, allowing point-and-click movement

*There is a setting that allows you to exit the Spidertron. This allows some features from other mods to work, such as entering a factory in [Factorisso2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2)

Other Info
-----

- Supports multiplayer, including different forces/factions
- Can be added or removed from existing saves at any time (but items and equipment stored in the Spidertron Engineer will be lost!)
- The whole Spidertron Engineer can fit inside trains and carriages (just press *Enter* next to one)
- Vanilla Spidertron is untouched and can be unlocked and used remotely as usual
- Upon death, all item's in the player's inventory are placed in the player's corpse as usual and all item's from the Spidertron Engineer are spilled onto the ground around the corpse
- Player reach increased by 3 tiles

-----
Limitations
