Spidertron Engineer
==================

Are you tired of walking around on only 2 legs? Now you can live your whole life as a hulking 8-legged spider mech!

-----
Features
-----

- Spawn from the start as a Spidertron (with no way to exit it!)
- Starting Spidertron stats are adjusted to be comparable to a normal engineer
- Reworked military and armor research technologies to add weapons, armor, inventory and equipment grid slots to the Spidertron instead
- For example, when the Modular Armor research is completed, 10 inventory slots, a small equipment grid, and increased health and resistances are applied directly to all players’ Spidertrons
- Vanilla Spidertron is untouched and can be unlocked and used remotely as usual
- Supports multiplayer including different forces/factions
- Can be added to existing save
- Player reach increased by 3 tiles 

-----
Limitations
-----
- Can’t use repair packs on other entities
- Can only heal yourself with fish or construction robots - auto-healing is not supported by the API
- Personal roboports can only work with robots and items in the Spidertron trunk
- Contents of Spidertron (trunk, ammo and equipment grid) are lost upon death (player inventory is stored in a retrievable corpse as usual)
- Battery charge in equipment grid is lost when the Spidertron Engineer upgrades

-----
Future Updates?
-----

- Improve visibility of Spidertron Engineer upgrades in tech tree
- Support for cannon shells
- Allow entering other vehicles directly from the Spidertron
- Proper Spidertron corpse with inventory upon death
- Quick switch between different weapon slots (eg press a button to switch from a 4 rocket launcher setup to a shotgun + flamethower setup)
- Let path speed bonuses affect the Spidertron 
- Option to start (and respawn) with a spidertron remote
