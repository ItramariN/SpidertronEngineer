Spidertron Engineer
==================

Are you tired of walking around on only 2 legs? Now you can live your whole life as a hulking 8-legged spider mech!

-----
Features
-----

- Spawn from the start as a Spidertron (with no way to exit it!*)
- Starting Spidertron stats are adjusted to be comparable to a normal engineer
- Reworked military and armor research technologies to add weapons, armor, inventory and equipment grid slots to the Spidertron instead
- For example, when the Modular Armor research is completed, 10 inventory slots, a small equipment grid, and increased health and resistances are applied directly to all players’ Spidertrons
- The whole Spidertron Engineer can fit inside trains and carriages
- Vanilla Spidertron is untouched and can be unlocked and used remotely as usual
- Supports multiplayer, including different forces/factions
- Can be added or removed from existing saves at any time (but items and equipment stored in the Spidertron Engineer will be lost!)
- Player reach increased by 3 tiles
- Upon death, all item's in the player's inventory are placed in the player's corpse as usual and all item's from the Spidertron Engineer are spilled onto the ground around the corpse
- Optionally spawn with a spidertron remote configured to control your own Spidertron Engineer, allowing point-and-click movement

*There is a setting that allows you to exit the Spidertron. This allows some features from other mods to work, such as entering a factory in [Factorisso2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2)

-----
Limitations
-----
- Can’t use repair packs on other entities
- Can only heal yourself with fish or construction robots - auto-healing is not properly supported by the API
- Personal roboports can only work with robots and items in the Spidertron trunk
- Equipment batteries cannot charge whilst in a train

-----
Future Updates?
-----

- Improve visibility of Spidertron Engineer upgrades in tech tree
- Support for cannon shells
- Proper Spidertron corpse with inventory upon death?
- Quick switch between different sets of weapon slots (eg press a button to switch from a 4 rocket launcher setup to a shotgun + flamethower setup)
- Let path speed bonuses affect the Spidertron
